1. Make sure you have updated the man pages under `doc/` if any relevant details
   have changed.
2. Make sure you write your change in CHANGELOG.md if it is "user-facing" (more
   than a simple code refactor or performance optimization).
3. Update config.toml if any config options were changed, added, or removed.
4. Add a copyright notice with your name to any source files you have changed.
   Just place it below mine in a similar format :)
5. Write a short commit message following the established pattern. For any
   non-trivial changes please write an extended commit message that can be used
   for future reference.
